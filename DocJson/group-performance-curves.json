Optional inputs for the curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation is:","","\\begin{equation}","\\Delta {P_{fan,tot}} = {C_1}*Q_{fan}^2 + {C_2}*Q_{fan}^{} + {C_3}*Q_{fan}^{}*\\sqrt {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}}  + {C_4}*\\left( {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}} \\right)","\\end{equation}","","where \\Delta P_{fan,tot} is the fan total pressure rise (Pa) as a function of volumetric flow through the fan (Q_{fan}, m^3/s ), duct static pressure set point (P_{sm} , Pa), and static pressure surrounding the ducts (P_o , Pa). P_o is assumed to be zero.","","The first term of the curve looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially ``leaks'' into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.","","The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.","","The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure {P_{sm}}, accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor correction to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.","","The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important correction to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.",""]},{"Name":"Curve:ExponentialSkewNormal","Subsubsections":[{"Name":"Inputs","Paragraph":[{"Name":"Field: Name","Note":["The required user-assigned unique alpha name for an instance of this curve.
