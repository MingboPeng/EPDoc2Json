The current field controls the choice of temperature.  For controls that are based more on zone load, the user can make one of two choices based on whether the zone load is met by only the convective output of the unit or the total output of the unit.  These zone load controls will not perform as precisely as air-based systems.  The convective zone load control will come close to meeting the current setpoint temperature (defined by the typical zone thermostat input by the user) since the convective output of the unit will be set to match the remaining zone load.  However, in the long run, this will likely overcool the space since radiant energy is being absorbed by surfaces and this will impact the zone conditions at later time steps.  The total zone load control will likely undercool the space in the short term since the total output (radiant and convective) of the unit will be set to meet the remaining zone load.

This is due to the fact that the surface temperature may drop below the dew-point temperature of the space. When this occurs, condensation on the surface will occur. Since there is no direct calculation of the surface temperature of the radiant cooling panel, the condensation check will be made at the inlet water temperature to the panel. Since the user can utilize the next parameter to adjust the differential between the dewpoint temperature and the inlet water temperature, this will allow some flexibility in controlling when the panel will shutdown to avoid condensation. There are three options for handling potential condensation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.","","","","  Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur.

With this option, the user also has the option to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Differential Parameter).","","  VariableOff - the program will attempt to reduce the inlet temperature to the panel by locally recirculating some of the water leaving the panel and mixing it with water from the overall demand side flow.  This also means that some of the demand side water will bypass the panel. In reality, this would require a pump to achieve such mixing and recirculation, but due to the simple nature of this model, no pump definition will be required.

It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed inlet water temperature to the radiant cooling panel before the system shuts down in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water (depending on whether SimpleOff or VariableOff is used) when the inlet temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature.

The performance of the unit is proportional to the difference between the water inlet temperature and the zone temperature where the zone temperature is found using a weighted average of zone mean radiant temperature and mean air temperature.  The weighting factor is this parameter, and it is multiplied by the zone mean radiant temperature.  The remainder of the zone temperature calculation is made up of the zone mean air temperature.  During modeling, it is likewise used to calculate how much of the energy being absorbed by the unit is radiant energy.  This parameter can be difficult to quantify as the fraction radiant can vary with zone conditions.
