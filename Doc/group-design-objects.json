{"subsection":[{"Name":"Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing","Subsubsections":[{"Name":"Overview","Note":["In order for EnergyPlus to successfully calculate zone design heating and cooling loads and air flow rates and for the program to use these results to automatically size the HVAC components a number of input objects must be present and certain object input fields must be entered.","","","","  The input file should contain a SimulationControl object. The 1^{st} field {Do Zone Sizing Calculation} should be entered as {Yes}. This will cause a zone sizing simulation to be done using all the sizing periods in the input file as weather. If there are no air or water loops in the HVAC input fields 2 and 3 can be set to {No.} If there are one or more air loops (i.e., there is at least one AirLoopHVAC object in the input file) then the 2^{nd} field {Do System Sizing Calculation} should be entered as {Yes}. If there are one or more water loops (Plant Loop objects) then the 3^{rd} field {Do Plant Sizing Calculation} should be set to {Yes}. Finally either the 4^{th} field ({Run Simulation for Sizing Periods}) or the 5^{th} field ({Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods}) should be set to {Yes} in order to autosize the components and do a real simulation using the autosized components. The component autosizing calculations are done on the first pass through the HVAC system in the real simulation.","","  There must be at least 2 (up to any number) SizingPeriod objects present. Normally one will be for summer conditions and one for winter. The summer day should normally have the field {Day Type} set to {SummerDesignDay}. The winter design day should normally have {Day Type} set to {WinterDesignDay}.","","  To apply a global sizing factor include the Sizing:Parameters object.","","  For each controlled zone in the input file there should be a corresponding Sizing:Zone object. Similarly for each AirLoopHVAC there should be a Sizing:System object. And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be a Sizing:Plant object. Note however that if a controlled zone has no corresponding Zone Sizing object the data from the first Zone Sizing object will be used. Thus if all the zone sizing information is the same only one Zone Sizing object need be entered.","","  Only controlled zones are included in the zone and system sizing calculations. Thus for a design air flow rate to be calculated for a zone, it must contain a thermostat {even though it might not need or have a thermostat in the full simulation}. An illustration would be a three zone building with a packaged single zone system and a thermostat in one of the zones. In order for the two slave zones to be included in the design air flow calculations they must be treated as if they have a thermostat: there must be a ZoneControl:Thermostat for each of the slave zones.","","  Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9^{th} and 10^{th} day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has field {Day Type} set to {SummerDesignDay} ~the day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has field {Day Type} set to {WinterDesignDay} ~the day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:","","","1)~~~setting internal loads (lights, equipment, occupancy) to maximum all day for cooling and to zero all day for heating;","","2)~~~setting heating and cooling thermostat set points to constant values (no set up or set back);","","3)~~~setting heating and cooling equipment to be always on.","","None of these applications are necessarily recommended but these and other uses of the special summer/winter design day schedules may prove useful for specific situations.","","","","  Other than zone thermostat setpoints, the sizing calculations generally know nothing about the system control inputs such as setpoints and availability schedules. The user must coordinate sizing inputs with the actual simulation control inputs.","","  The sizing calculations only recognize the presence of central heating and cooling coils, preheat and precool coils and reheat coils. These are assumed to deliver the various supply temperatures specified in the Sizing:System and Sizing:Zone objects. The impact of other components such as heat recovery, dehumidifiers, and pumps are not accounted for in the sizing calculations. Central supply and return fan temperature rise is taken into account in sizing the central cooling coils.","",""]},{"Name":"Component Autosizing","Note":["For autosizing to occur at the component level the user must enter the special value {autosize} in the numeric fields for which autosizing is available. Those fields can be found by looking at the Energy+.idd data dictionary file or under individual object details in this document. Fields that can be autosized are denoted with the comment {\\textbackslash{}autosizable}. The components and fields that are autosizable are listed in the following table.

can specify an over-all sizing factor. This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations.","","2.~~~~In Zone Sizing (object: Sizing:Zone), the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in the Sizing:Zone object. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is, a zone sizing factor, if specified, replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone.","","3.~~~~For some plant components (basically all central chillers, boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps.","","a.~~~~For supply side branches, the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor.","","b.~~~For each loop, if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized).",""]},{"Name":"Mixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs","Note":["Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed.","","1.~~~~Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components' autosized flow rates. For instance, specifying the chilled water loop pump's rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller's design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop's autosized maximum loop flow rate.","","2.~~~~Within a component it is best to autosize all inputs are enter specified values for all inputs. For example, in a chiller, if only the nominal capaciity is user-specified, the autosized chilled water flow rate may not be consistent with the specified capacity.","","3.~~~~Sizing information flows only from the sizing objects to the components. The sizing calculations have no knowledge of user-specified values in a component. The only exception to this rule is that plant loop sizing will collect all component design water flow rates whether autosized or user-specified.","","4.~~~~If the user wants to specify a zone or system air flow rate it should be done using the Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System~ objects rather than done in the individual components.","","5.~~~~The plant loop flow rates are sized from the total design demand of the components connected to each loop. The components demanding water need not be autosized for the plant loop autosizing to work successfully. So the user could specify all the air side components and autosize all the plant loops and plant components.
