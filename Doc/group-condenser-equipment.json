The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a single-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding airflow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.","","The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is below the set point, the tower will operate in FluidBypass mode -- portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the water setpoint temperature. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan on for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the tower cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.","","Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).","","For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.","","For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:","","","","  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;","","  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity","","  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)","",""]},{"Name":"CoolingTower:TwoSpeed","Subsubsections":[{"Name":"Inputs","Paragraph":[{"Name":"Field: Water Inlet Node Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Water Outlet Node Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Design Water Flow Rate","Note":["This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s.

The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a two-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding air flow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.","","The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature. If operating the tower fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed.","","The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.","","Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.","","For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.","","For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:","","","","  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;","","  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity","","  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)","","","{{Field: Name}}","","This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.",""]},{"Name":"CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel","Subsubsections":[{"Name":"Inputs","Paragraph":[{"Name":"Field: Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Water Inlet Node Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Water Outlet Node Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Performance Input Method","Note":["This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' or ``{NominalCapacity}''.

The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate (within ??25% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate), air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.","","The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'' on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the variable-speed tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature is above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the variable-speed tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature. Tower fan power is calculated based on the tower air flow rate required to achieve the exiting water set point temperature.","","Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.","","For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.","","For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:","","","","  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;","","  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity","","  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)","",""]},{"Name":"CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools","Subsubsections":[{"Name":"Inputs","Paragraph":[{"Name":"Field: Name","Note":["This alpha field contains the identifying name for the variable speed cooling tower model coefficients.",""]},{"Name":"Field: Minimum Inlet Air Wet-Bulb Temperature","Note":["This numeric field contains the minimum inlet air wet-bulb temperature to be used by the model (approach temperature correlation).

Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified.

The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the fluid cooler cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature.

The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point.

designed to couple the supply side of one plant or condenser loop to the demand side of another plant or condenser loop.","This heat exchanger is fairly general and can be configured for use in any application where any two loops need to be connected together.","The only constraints are that that one side must be connected to the supply side of one loop and the other side connected to the demand side of a different loop.","","Because the heat exchanger is intended to be generic, its two sides are distinguished by the nature of loop side being connected.","One side is called {Loop Supply Side} to indicate the heat exchanger is situated on the supply side of a loop.","The other side is called {Loop Demand Side} to indicate it is on the demand side of a loop.","The heat exchanger is intended to act as a supply component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Supply Side''","and as a demand component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Demand Side.''","From the point of view of the heat exchanger model itself, the Loop Demand Side fluid serves as the source/sink to supply heating/cooling to the fluid in the Loop Supply Side.","","This heat exchanger can be used for a wide variety of applications including chilled water, hot water, condenser, ground source, primary-secondary systems, etc.","Heat transfer is calculated and reported using a sign convention from chilled water applications","where {positive heat transfer indicates energy was extracted from the Loop Supply Side and added to the Loop Demand Side.}","","{Note}: Only hydronic ``plant'' fluids are allowed
