As with the main plant and condenser statements, several of the items in the AirLoopHVAC object definition are actually names that refer to other objects in the input file. After the AirLoopHVAC object name, four such list pointers are encountered: for controllers, system availability, branches, and connectors. The Controller List defines how the air loop will respond due to various inputs (control signals). The Availability Manager List refers to methods for controlling when a system is operational. This may be as simple as a schedule to define when the system is shutdown. The Branch List lists the branches that comprise the primary air system. Finally, the Connector List lists the connections between the branches. The branches and connections together define the primary air system topology.","","The only numeric input is the design primary air flow rate. This item is input just before the BranchList name.","","The next series of names refer to nodes for the various inlet and outlet points of the air loop. The air loop starts where the zone equipment ends. This is a single point consisting of the return air duct once all of the zone return air streams have been collected (if the loop has a return path). While in reality, there is really only one point, for clarity within the simulation components and consistency with the other HVAC loop sections, this point in the systems is defined as two points: one that resides with the zone equipment simulation and one that is acted upon by the air loop simulation. Both node names must be entered into the input file (if the loop has a return path), and both nodes must have unique names. Similarly, the end points of the air loop that also correspond to the beginning points of the zone equipment loop must also be defined.
